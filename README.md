# <h1><center>XDL - A Youtube-dl Addon</center></h1>

  <b>Sometimes</b> I like to download a series of videos. So I wrote this script to make life easier. I'm sharing it, in case anyone also finds it useful. I will be working on adding new features soon. If you would like to contribute, feel free to shoot me an email. 

This script takes a list of youtube URLS and proceds to download them  
It either takes or creates a directory to place the files in them. 
  
This script is more of an add-on to youtube-dl. 

#OPTIONS

<b>Dependencies:</b>
