# <h1><center>XDL - A Video Download Command Line Tool</center></h1>

#DESCRIPTION 
  I like to download a series of videos and podcasts to watch with kodi. So I wrote this script to make life easier. It handles the creation of folders and the downloading of playlist, podcast syncs. I'm sharing it in case anyone else also finds it useful. I will be working on adding new features. If you would like to contribute, feel free to shoot me an email. 



#OPTIONS
    python xdl.py -l        To provide a list of youtube URLS to download.
    python xdl.py -up       Syncs podcasts
    python xdl.py -p URL    Downloads a youtube Playlist
    
#Dependencies
